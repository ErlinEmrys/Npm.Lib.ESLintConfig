>>       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

>>       as of the date such litigation is filed.
>>
>>    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
>>       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
>>       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
>>       meet the following conditions:

>>           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
>>           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
>>           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
>>           the Derivative Works; and
>>
>>       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>>           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
>>           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
>>           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
>>           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
>>           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
>>           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
>>           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
>>           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
>>           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>>           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
>>           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
>>           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
>>           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
>>           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
>>           as modifying the License.
>>
>>       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
>>       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
>>       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
>>       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
>>       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
>>       the conditions stated in this License.
>>
>>    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>>       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>>       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>>       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>>       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>>       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>>       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
>>
>>    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
>>       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
>>       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
>>       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
>>
>>    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
>>       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
>>       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
>>       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
>>       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
>>       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
>>       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
>>       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
>>       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
>>
>>    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
>>       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
>>       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
>>       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
>>       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
>>       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
>>       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
>>       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
>>       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>>       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>>       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
>>
>>    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>>       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>>       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>>       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>>       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>>       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>>       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>>       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>>       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>>       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
>>
>>    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

>>
>>    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

>>       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
>>       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
>>       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
>>
>>    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
>>       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
>>       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
>>       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
>>       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
>>       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
>>       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
>>       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
>>       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>>       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>>       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
>>
>>    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

>>       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
>>       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

>>
>>       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
>>       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
>>       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
>>       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
>>       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
>>       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
>>       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
>>
>>       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

>>       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
>>       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
>>       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

>>       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
>>       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
>>       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
>>       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
>>       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
>>       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
>>       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
>>       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
>>       as of the date such litigation is filed.
>>
>>    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
>>       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
>>       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
>>       meet the following conditions:

>>       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
>>           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
>>
>>       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
>>           stating that You changed the files; and
>>
>>       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
>>           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
>>           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
>>           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
>>           the Derivative Works; and
>>
>>       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>>           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
>>           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
>>           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
>>           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
>>           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
>>           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
>>           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
>>           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
>>           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>>           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
>>           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
>>           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
>>           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
>>           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
>>           as modifying the License.
>>
>>       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
>>       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
>>       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
>>       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
>>       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
>>       the conditions stated in this License.
>>
>>    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>>       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>>       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>>       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>>       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>>       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>>       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
>>
>>    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
>>       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
>>       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
>>       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
>>
>>    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
>>       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
>>       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
>>       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
>>       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
>>       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
>>       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
>>       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
>>       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
>>
>>    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
>>       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
>>       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
>>       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
>>       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
>>       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
>>       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
>>       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
>>       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>>       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>>       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
>>
>>    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>>       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>>       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>>       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>>       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>>       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>>       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>>       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>>       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>>       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

>>       To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following

>>       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
>>       the conditions stated in this License.
>>
>>    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>>       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>>       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>>       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>>       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>>       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>>       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
>>
>>    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
>>       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
>>       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
>>       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
>>
>>    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
>>       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
>>       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
>>       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

>>       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
>>       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>>       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>>       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
>>
>>    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>>       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>>       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>>       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>>       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

>> A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
>> ==========================
>>
>> Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
>> Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
>> as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
>> principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
>>
>> In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
>> National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
>> in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
>> software.
>>
>> In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
>> BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
>> year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
>> Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
>> https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
>> created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
>> Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
>>
>> All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
>> the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
>> releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
>> the various releases.
>>
>>     Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
>>                     from                                compatible? (1)
>>
>>     0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
>>     1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
>>     1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
>>     2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
>>     1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
>>     2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
>>     2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
>>     2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
>>     2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
>>     2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
>>     2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
>>
>> Footnotes:
>>
>> (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
>>     the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
>>     a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
>>     GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
>>     other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
>>
>> (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
>>     because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
>>     CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
>>     is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
>>
>> Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
>> direction to make these releases possible.

>> Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
>>
>> Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and

>> following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not

>>
>>      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
>>      intended for use by those authorized to give the public
>>      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
>>      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
>>      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
>>      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
>>      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
>>      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
>>      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
>>      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
>>      licensed material, or material used under an exception or
>>      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

>>      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
>>      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
>>      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
>>      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
>>      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
>>      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
>>      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
>>      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
>>      the licensed material may still be restricted for other
>>      reasons, including because others have copyright or other
>>      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
>>      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
>>      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
>>      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

>>
>>
>> Section 1 -- Definitions.
>>
>>   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
>>      Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
>>      and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
>>      arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
>>      permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
>>      Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
>>      Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
>>      Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
>>      synched in timed relation with a moving image.
>>
>>   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
>>      and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
>>      accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
>>
>>   c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
>>      closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
>>      performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
>>      Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or

>>      specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
>>      Rights.
>>
>>   d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
>>      absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
>>      fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
>>      Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
>>      agreements.
>>
>>   e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
>>      any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
>>      that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
>>
>>   f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
>>      or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
>>      License.
>>
>>   g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
>>      terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
>>      all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
>>      Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
>>
>>   h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
>>      under this Public License.
>>
>>   i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
>>      process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
>>      as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
>>      dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
>>      available to the public including in ways that members of the
>>      public may access the material from a place and at a time
>>      individually chosen by them.
>>
>>   j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
>>      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
>>      the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,

>>      equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
>>
>>   k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
>>      under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
>>
>>
>> Section 2 -- Scope.
>>
>>   a. License grant.
>>
>>        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
>>           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
>>           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
>>           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
>>
>>             a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
>>                in part; and
>>
>>             b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
>>
>>        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
>>           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
>>           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
>>           its terms and conditions.
>>
>>        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
>>           6(a).
>>
>>        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
>>           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
>>           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
>>           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
>>           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
>>           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
>>           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
>>           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
>>           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
>>           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
>>           (4) never produces Adapted Material.
>>
>>        5. Downstream recipients.
>>
>>             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
>>                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
>>                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
>>                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
>>                Public License.
>>
>>             b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
>>                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
>>                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
>>                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
>>                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
>>                Material.
>>
>>        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
>>           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
>>           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
>>           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
>>           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
>>           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
>>
>>   b. Other rights.
>>
>>        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
>>           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
>>           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
>>           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
>>           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
>>           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
>>           Rights, but not otherwise.
>>
>>        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
>>           Public License.
>>
>>        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
>>           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
>>           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
>>           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
>>           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
>>           reserves any right to collect such royalties.
>>
>>
>> Section 3 -- License Conditions.
>>
>> Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
>> following conditions.
>>
>>   a. Attribution.
>>
>>        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
>>           form), You must:
>>
>>             a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
>>                with the Licensed Material:
>>
>>                  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
>>                     Material and any others designated to receive
>>                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
>>                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
>>                     designated);
>>
>>                 ii. a copyright notice;
>>
>>                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
>>
>>                 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
>>                     warranties;
>>
>>                  v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
>>                     extent reasonably practicable;
>>
>>             b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
>>                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
>>
>>             c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
>>                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
>>                hyperlink to, this Public License.
>>
>>        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
>>           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
>>           which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
>>           reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
>>           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
>>           information.
>>
>>        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
>>           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
>>           reasonably practicable.
>>
>>        4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
>>           License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
>>           Material from complying with this Public License.
>>
>>
>> Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
>>
>> Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
>> apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
>>
>>   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
>>      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
>>      portion of the contents of the database;
>>
>>   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
>>      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
>>      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
>>      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
>>
>>   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
>>      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
>>
>> For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
>> replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
>> Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
>>
>>
>> Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
>>
>>   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
>>      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
>>      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
>>      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
>>      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
>>      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
>>      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
>>      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
>>      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
>>      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
>>
>>   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
>>      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
>>      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
>>      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
>>      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
>>      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
>>      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
>>      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
>>      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
>>
>>   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
>>      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
>>      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
>>      waiver of all liability.
>>
>>
>> Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
>>
>>   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
>>      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
>>      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
>>      terminate automatically.
>>
>>   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
>>      Section 6(a), it reinstates:
>>
>>        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
>>           it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
>>           violation; or
>>
>>        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
>>
>>      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
>>      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
>>      of this Public License.
>>
>>   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
>>      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
>>      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
>>      will not terminate this Public License.
>>
>>   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
>>      License.
>>
>>
>> Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
>>
>>   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
>>      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
>>
>>   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
>>      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
>>      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
>>
>>
>> Section 8 -- Interpretation.
>>
>>   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
>>      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
>>      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
>>      be made without permission under this Public License.
>>
>>   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
>>      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
>>      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
>>      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
>>      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
>>      conditions.
>>
>>   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
>>      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
>>      Licensor.
>>
>>   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
>>      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
>>      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
>>      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
